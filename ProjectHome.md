The Physical Travelling Salesman Problem (PTSP) is a modification of the well-known combinatorial optimisation problem, the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The goal of this competition is to allow practitioners to compete in a domain that is less complex than most other game-based competitions while retaining some of the essential aspects of modern video games. In particular, the PTSP requires navigation of a single-point mass, an abstraction of a concept found in many modern video games. Despite its simplicity, the PTSP bears significant resemblance to some older video games, including CrystalQuest?, XQuest and Crazy Taxi.

The PTSP is a single player, real-time game, where the objective is to direct the agent to visit all waypoints scattered around a map as quickly as possible.
